# About

Techfluent is an organization that is dedicated to helping kids and young adults become exposed and familiar with the tech world by partaking in projects and in "real-like" work situations. TFT is flexible and determined to give each person, regardless of income, race, gender, and religion, to have a unique impact to their local communities using the power of technology.

### History

Techfluent was founded by a high school sophomore named Sami Elsayed who has a huge interest in coding, building computers, and helping others for the common good. Techfluent first went public on October 30, 2022, with only Elsayed working on the project.

### Our Vision

We have a clear vision: to help kids and even young adults to become better innovators and critical thinkers. We believe that the power of tech can creatively shape the lives of many people.
